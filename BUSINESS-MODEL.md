# GolemDB Studio - ETHWarsaw Business Model Bounty Submission

## **Value Proposition**

- A **user-friendly web studio** for Golem DB that turns complex entity management into a visual, intuitive experience.
- Helps developers, analysts, and non-technical users interact with Golem DB through **dashboards, CRUD tools, batch import, and query playgrounds**.
- Adds **visual analytics** and upcoming **AI-powered querying** (“talk to your entities”), bridging blockchain data and real-world usability.

---

## **Target Group**

- **Web3 Developers** who want to build apps on Golem DB but need faster iteration tools.
- **Hackathon Teams** who need quick visibility into entities without learning the low-level SDK.
- **Organizations / DAOs** managing structured data on-chain (tickets, logs, posts, IoT events).
- **Data analysts & researchers** curious about querying decentralized databases.

---

## **Revenue Streams**

1. **SaaS Subscriptions**

   - **Free Tier**: limited collections & entities, playground only.
   - **Pro Tier**: unlimited CRUD, batch import/export, AI assistant.
   - **Enterprise**: multi-user orgs, dedicated infra, priority RPC.

2. **Usage-Based Pricing**

   - Credits for **batch imports**, **large queries**, or **long-term storage**.

3. **AI Add-Ons**
   - Paid credits for **natural language querying**, **training datasets**, and **recommendations**.

---

## **Costs**

- **Infrastructure**:
  - RPC node access (Kaolin / Golem DB).
  - Hosting for dashboard + query playground.
- **Development**:
  - Ongoing engineering (Next.js, SDK integration, UI/UX).
  - AI integration costs (OpenAI API or fine-tuned models).
- **Customer support & community**: docs, Discord, onboarding.
- **Business development**: hackathon sponsorships, marketing, outreach.

## **Go-to-Market Strategy**

- **Hackathons-first**: launch at ETHWarsaw and similar events to capture developer mindshare.
- **Community building**: Discord/TG for early adopters, tutorials, and feedback loops.
- **Open source core**: free base Studio for devs, with premium SaaS layers for scale/AI features.
- **Partnerships**: work with Golem DB team, ETHGlobal, and DAOs to become the default “explorer + studio” for entity management.
